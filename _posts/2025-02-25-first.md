After starting my PhD (~5 months ago as per the time of this first post), I quickly realized that I lack the ability to compile ideas and present them in an accurate, comprehensive, and understandable way. So, on this GitHub page, to train myself, I'll try to (as often as possible) do blog posts about my life as a PhD student in Japan and maybe share some interesting thoughts/findings related to my study.
